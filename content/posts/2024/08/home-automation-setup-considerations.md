When starting a home automation setup in a new (or existing) property, several key points of consideration should be made to ensure high availability of services and overall system efficiency.

### 1\. Partner Approval Factor (PAF)

- When designing a home automation setup for a new home, the PAF is top of my list is. Without it you're doomed to wasted time/effort/money and possibly worse.

- If you install lights in the pantry that come on when the door is opened and they light up the otherwise dark room, that's a PAF winner. If however, the lights in the ensuite bathroom come on during the night when the pets roam around the house you really are playing with peace.

- Ensure there's a manual override on everything you do. You need a 'human' way to turn on/off anything that's automated without stuffing up the automation. Your partner should not need to install/use the app that's installed with your latest zigbee light/motion sensor etc.

### 2\. Infrastructure Planning

- **Wiring and Connectivity:** Ensure the property has robust wiring infrastructure, including CAT6/7 cables for high-speed internet and dedicated circuits for smart devices. Consider PoE (Power over Ethernet) for devices requiring both power and data connectivity.

- **Network Architecture:** Plan for a resilient and high-bandwidth home network. Use a mesh Wi-Fi system or a combination of wired and wireless networks to cover all areas with minimal latency and interference.

- **Central Wiring Cabinet:** Route your cables back to the one termination point where you can hook up all the other gear (preferably out of the way and silent). Nobody wants to hear your server farm humming away as they try to sleep.

- **Power Management:** Install Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) and consider backup power solutions like generators or solar panels with battery storage to ensure continuous operation during power outages.

- **Abundant Network Points:** If you can, run your cables to as many access points as makes sense. If you ever move, the new homeowner may thank you as their TV goes to the other end of the room and the study desk gets moved to the front bedroom, not the office.

### 3\. System Integration

- **Centralised Control Hub:** Use a central control hub that can integrate various smart devices and systems (e.g., lighting, security, HVAC). Popular platforms include Home Assistant (my preferred), SmartThings, or Hubitat.

- **1 Hub, 2 Hub, 3 Hub 4:** Try to avoid hub-central with one for your Philips devices, another for Tuya, another forâ€¦If all the devices you use conform to a single protocol (such as Zigbee), then you should need a single Zigbee dongle with a single software instance of MQTT and Zigbee2Mqtt working together. Ditch the plastic boxes, put them on marketplace and simplify your world.

- **Compatibility and Interoperability:** Ensure devices and systems are compatible with major home automation protocols like Zigbee, Z-Wave, and MQTT. This facilitates seamless integration and control.

- **APIs and Extensibility:** Choose systems that offer open APIs, allowing for customization and integration with third-party services and applications.

### 4\. Security and Privacy

- **Network Security:** Implement strong security measures, including firewalls, VLANs, and regular firmware updates to protect against cyber threats. Run your IOT gear on a segmented VLAN if possible.

- **Data Privacy:** Use systems that prioritise data encryption and privacy, minimising data exposure and potential misuse.

- **Access Control:** Employ multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control to restrict access to critical systems and devices.

### 5\. Redundancy and High Availability

- **Redundant Systems:** Deploy redundant network devices (routers, switches) and paths to avoid single points of failure.

- **Failover Mechanisms:** Implement automatic failover systems for critical services, ensuring continuous operation even if primary components fail.

- **Cloud vs. Local Control:** Balance the use of cloud-based services with local control options to ensure that basic functions can continue without internet connectivity.

- **Spare Gear:** Purchase a spare version of any component that's a critical piece of infrastructure and ensur its configuration is kept in sync with the working version (think spare zigbee dongle).

### 6\. Scalability and Future-Proofing

- **Modular Design:** Opt for modular systems that can be easily expanded or upgraded as technology evolves or needs change.

- **Firmware and Software Updates:** Ensure that devices and systems receive regular updates to maintain security and add new features. Note: Auto applying updates may not always be the way to go as it may introduce breaking changes leaving you scratching your head as to what happened.

- **Standards Compliance:** Choose devices and systems that comply with industry standards to ensure compatibility with future technologies.

- Avoid Wifi devices as much as possible and opt for Zigbee/Zwave as wifi increases chatter, whereas Z/Z will work as a mech network - more devices the happier (generally).

### 7\. User Experience

- **Ease of Use:** Prioritise user-friendly interfaces and voice control options (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant) to enhance usability.

- **Automation and Customisation:** Leverage automation rules and routines to create a seamless and personalised home environment.

- **Support and Community:** Select systems with robust customer support and active user communities for troubleshooting and advice.

### 8\. Environmental Control

- **Climate Control:** Integrate smart thermostats and HVAC systems to optimize energy usage and maintain comfortable living conditions.

- **Lighting:** Use smart lighting systems with scheduling and adaptive lighting capabilities to enhance ambiance and efficiency.

- **Water Management:** Implement smart irrigation systems and leak detectors to manage water usage and prevent damage.

### 9\. Legal and Regulatory Compliance

- **Building Codes:** Ensure that all installations comply with local building codes and regulations.

- **Permits and Inspections:** Obtain necessary permits and schedule inspections for any significant electrical or structural modifications.

- **Electrical Work:** If in doubt, dont touch it. Get an electrician to do anything of any importance with your power. Not only is this a safety call, but they'll probably complete the job in half the time you will, and you can sleep better at night knowing you got a good job done.
