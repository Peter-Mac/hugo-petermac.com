This is an extract from a plan outlining key tasks I use as a guide to technology consuting in a new organisation. Depending on the nature of the engagement, there are some elements that are more prominent than others, but it's a starting point for getting stuff 'DONE' in the first 3 or so months of an engagement.  It needs to be culled depending on role i.e. General technology consulting of specific enterprise architect.
