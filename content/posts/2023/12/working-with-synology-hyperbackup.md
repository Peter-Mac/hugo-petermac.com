How do I know what was backed up on hyperbackup? I have an hbk file but I cannot open it or see its size.

```

So actually use hyper backup, hyper backup explorer on a supported client pc/laptop device or hyper vault (the latter if you use a 2nd synology as backup target) and work from there.

And a backup is only as good as the last succesful restore one is able to perform with it. So not unless tested and verified, a backup in and by itself is worthless.
