## About Me

I'm Peter, welcome to my humble little site.

I'm based in Melbourne Australia (originally from Ireland) and work as a consulting Technology Architect for a broad range of organisations.

I'm also a technology tinkerer which means I've generally got a few projects on the go trying out new things to see how they work.

My interests include:
- Web technologies (mainly backend focus)
- Home Automation (Using Home Assistant)
- Photography (Nikon, Fujifilm, Street, Landscape, People)
- Motorcycling (Adventure riding, off roading, Royal Enfield Himalayan, BMW GS 650)
- Cycling (Giant Trek (~2003) and Cervelo S3 (~2014))

This is what ChatGPT says about me...

"As a seasoned consulting Technology Architect, Peter's skills are targeted at helping businesses transform their IT landscape through strategic planning and innovative solutions. His expertise lies in understanding current technologies and providing advice on cost effective recommendations to help prepare your business for the future."

Note: ChatGPT never hallucinates :)

I've spent the last 30 or so years working in corporate land designing and implementing large scale technology platforms and transitions to cloud hosted environments.  More recently, I've been working with Generative AI and all the unknowns and heightened expectations in that domain.
